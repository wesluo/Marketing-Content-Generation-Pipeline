The common thread? None of them regret it.\n\nFrom my research, drivers who establish and enforce clear safety boundaries report fewer incidents and actually maintain better long-term ratings. Your platform may temporarily ding you, but your safety record (and peace of mind) matters more.\n\nWhat's your experience? Have you ever had to ask a passenger to leave? What was your decision-making process?\n\nLooking to start a genuine discussion about driver safety protocols and how we can better protect ourselves while still earning."
