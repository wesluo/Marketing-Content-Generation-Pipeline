When drivers feel pressured to prioritize speed over safety due to delivery quotas and rating systems, pedestrian safety suffers. What systemic changes would actually address this? Should platforms be held accountable for safety metrics alongside delivery times? Interested in perspectives from both drivers and pedestrians who've witnessed these pressures firsthand."
