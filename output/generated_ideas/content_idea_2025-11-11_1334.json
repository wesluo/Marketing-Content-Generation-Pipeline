A binary background check system misses the bigger picture - consistent safe driving patterns matter more than isolated incidents in bad conditions. What are your thoughts on fairer assessment systems that actually measure ongoing safety behavior rather than just checking for any accidents?"

      "score": 8,
      "score_rationale": "Highly relevant to gig driver audience with strong emotional resonance. Directly connects to Zenlit's value proposition of rewarding consistent safe driving patterns. Timely given ongoing gig economy employment debates. Strong advocacy angle positions Zenlit as addressing real systemic issues. Minor limitation: specific to one platform (GrubHub) but broadly applicable to gig economy screening practices.",
