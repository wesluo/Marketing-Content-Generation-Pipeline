Saw a post about someone leaving Uber after experiencing safety issues on 3 consecutive rides. It got me thinking about how systematic safety failures affect both drivers and passengers in the gig economy. What safety features or incentives would actually make a difference? Genuinely curious what drivers prioritize when choosing which platform to drive for—is safety even factored in, or is it all about earnings potential?
